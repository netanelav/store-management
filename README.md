# Store Backoffice

11th Assignment for Appleseed's Academy Coding Bootcamp.

Store Backoffice is a web application that allows store management, users can browse and search the products in the store and the admin can change categories, products and generally control the entire store. 

In this assignment, we received a code that had partial front-end implementation and needed to understand the code flow, implement the entire server-side, create all the endpoints, and make the app work.

The assignment is based on the following subjects:

* Python
* MySQL Database
* OOP & Abstract Classes
